                Happiest birthday!!.. To the special person who adds sparkle to my life.âœ¨ <br><br>
                I hope you enjoy your birthday with endless joy and happiness.  
                I want you to be happy always.  
                You will achieve everything you wished for, and your dreams will come true.  
                God bless you Mr.Thejuoo..<br><br>
                I wish that I want to be with you and enjoy this day ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ.  
                I'm thinking why I'm crazy about you.  
                I'm excited to make more memories with you.  
                I just wanted to let you know how much you truly mean to me.  
                You are more than just a friend to me!..  
                I'm so grateful for our friendship ðŸ’—.  
                You bring so much love, support, and care into my life.<br><br>
                Actually, now I'm reminded of all the late-night talks during exams,  
                silly jokes, and the advice you gave me.  
                I guess everyone wishes to have a friend like you.  
                When I think of us, you have been with me when I felt low and encouraged me.  
                I don't know what I would do without you.  
                You are one that I don't wanna lose in my life.  
                I feel so lucky to have you in my life.  
                I respect you a lot, and hereafter I will follow your instructions (advice) based on both studies and health.  
                On your birthday, I want to celebrate our friendship too..<br><br>
                I have hurt you more, but I didn't mean to do that, so I'm sorry for that.  
                I don't like to share my best friend with anyone.  
                "I see you making new friends, but don't forget that I'm thereâ€¦  
                Hope they know I was here first!  
                I think I have full rights over you, no one else is allowed to take my place!  
                I just feel weird (like fear of losing you, my mood automatically goes down,  
                and I start to overthink a lot (What if you replace me))  
                when you spend too much time with othersâ€¦ donâ€™t forget me!"  
                I can't go a day without having at least a small conversation with you.<br><br>
                Here's another year of friendship, laughter, and memories together.  
                You deserve all the happiness that you need.  
                Once again, wishing you a very very happy birthday My Bestest Friend!!..ðŸ«‚ðŸ’—âœ¨
